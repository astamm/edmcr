Title: Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion Tools
Description: Implements various general algorithms to estimate missing elements
   of a Euclidean (squared) distance matrix.  
   Includes optimization methods based on semi-definite programming, 
   nonparametric position, and dissimilarity parameterization formulas.
   When the only non-missing
   distances are those on the minimal spanning tree, the guided random search
   algorithm will complete the matrix while preserving the minimal spanning tree.
   Point configurations in specified dimensions can be determined from the completions. 
   Special problems such as the sensor localization problem and reconstructing
   the geometry of a molecular structure can also be solved.
